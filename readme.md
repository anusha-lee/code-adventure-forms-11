#Code Adventure - Unit 3: Forms

This Code Adventure is all about getting some extra 
practice building and styling forms.

1) Take a look at the screenshots in the form_exampls 
   folder.  

2) Choose one or more to recreate.

3) Add the needed markup to the index.html file.  Make 
   sure you adhere to the best practices you've learned 
   in unit/project three.

   - Use only one set of form tags that encapsulate the 
     entire form and all of its elements.
     
   - Use fieldset and legend tags if needed to separate 
     sections of the form.
     
   - Give your input tags an appropriate type, name, id 
     and class attribute if necessary.
     
   - Give your input tags functioning labels with for
     attributes that match the id attribute of their
     corresponding input.
   
   - Use checkboxes when multiple selections are possible
     and radio buttons when only one selection is possible.
     
   - Use an input with the type of "submit" for the submit
     button.

4) Use the css/styles.css file to add the necessary styles 
   to make your form match your chosen form example.
   
5) Have some fun with it!  :)
